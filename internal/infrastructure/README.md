The `internal/infrastructure` folder typically contains code that implements the infrastructure or technical details of a system. This might include code for interacting with databases, messaging systems, logging frameworks, or other external dependencies.

The `pkg` folder contains shared packages that are used across the infrastructure layer, such as error handling and middleware packages. 

The `utils` folder contains utility functions that are used throughout the infrastructure layer, such as random number generation and time manipulation functions.

The `database` folder might contain code that is used for storing and querying domain-specific data, such as users, orders, or products.

The `storage` folder might contain code that is used for storing and retrieving more general types of data, such as files, images, or logs.
